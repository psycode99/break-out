# break-out
The arcade game Break Out created by Steve Wozniak.
This project is written in python using the Turtle graphics module.
Everything works apart from a reset functionality which will be implemented in future builds.
Most of the code is written using OOP.
Forgive the number of for loops implemented in this first build.
